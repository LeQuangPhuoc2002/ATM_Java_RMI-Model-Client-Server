This project encompasses a suite of functionalities, elegantly designed for an ATM system using Java RMI and a client-server architecture:
- Login: Securely access the system with user credentials.
- Logout: Safely exit the system, ensuring user privacy.
- Withdrawal: Enable users to withdraw funds from their account.
- Deposit: Facilitate the process of adding funds to an account.
- Fund Transfer: Empower users to seamlessly transfer money between accounts.
- Check Balance: Provide real-time access to account balances.
- View Receipts: Allow users to review transaction receipts for a comprehensive financial overview.
- Transaction History: Furnish a detailed record of past transactions for user reference.
- Change PIN: Ensure account security with the ability to modify personal identification numbers.

Utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 for database management and NetBeans IDE 8.2 for Java source code execution, this project mandates two interconnected machines: one for the client (Phuoc_Client_FINAL) and the other for the server (Nganhang_Server_final). The integration relies on a shared network for seamless communication between the two components.
